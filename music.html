                                <h3>Either/Or</h3>
                                <h4>Elliott Smith, <i>1997</i></h4>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>Elliott Smith has quickly become one of my favourite artists, and probably my favourite solo artist, of all time. I first heard this album (and Elliott) through <i>Between the Bars</i> in late 2022, and it was completely haunting. As much as I liked that song, though, I didn't listen to more until early 2024 when I listened to <i>Say Yes</i>. After that, I listened to the whole album and it's now my most listened-to album of all time (not even including vinyl spins). </p>

                                <h3>IGOR</h3>
                                <h4>Tyler, the Creator, <i>2019</i></h4>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>My friends got me this vinyl for my birthday (fun fact: the album cover is with an enlarged Tyler, the Creator, as a reference to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tylerthecreator/comments/128369n/why_is_my_igor_vinyl_fat/">this image</a>, an inside joke in my friend group). I haven't listened to this album as often as I have the other ones (I think I've only listened to it once on vinyl), but the backstory behind this vinyl makes it one of my favourites in my collection.</p>

                                <h3>Unknown Pleasures</h3>
                                <h4>Joy Division, <i>1979</i></h4>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>I'm kind of a sucker for depressing music... This is the most hollow, depressing (but in a dread way) album I've ever listened to, and I love it. I won't lie, it takes some getting used to (especially Ian Curtis' polarizing vocals, RIP), but I love this record.</p>

                                <h4>C418, <i>2011</i></h4>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>This is my most listened-to vinyl out of my collection, and it's not close. I bought this album (along with two more on this list) on a trip downtown with some friends, and we took turns listening to this music on the top floor of a library. That was probably one of the most transcendent experiences in recent memory.</p>

                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>If you think of an album that would sound great on vinyl, with its crackly, "warm" feel, this is high up on that list for me. This album really makes you <i>FEEL</i> like you're living in a cabin in Wisconsin. The songs <i>Skinny Love</i> and <i>Flume</i> are my favourites on this thing.</p>

                                <h3>Grace</h3>
                                <h4>Jeff Buckley, <i>1994</i></h4>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>One of the most heart-wrenching albums out there, but in a "crying in the rain" or "crying in a bathroom at prom" way, not at a "crying at a funeral" kind of way, if that makes sense. Jeff Buckley has one of the best voices I've ever heard. I used to only like the title track, <i>Grace</i>, but recently I've come to appreciate songs like <i>Hallelujah</i>, <i>Dream Brother</i>, and especially <i>Lover, You Should've Come Over</i>.</p>

                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>This, along with <i>IGOR</i>, are the two albums I have that I didn't explicitly ask for. My dad bought this for me, as we started bonding over old-school hiphop in early 2024. This is an absolute staple of that genre. The songs <i>N.Y. State of Mind</i> and <i>The World is Yours</i> are some of my favourite hip hop songs of all time, especially the latter.</p>

                                <h4>Neutral Milk Hotel, <i>1998</i></h4>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>Yeah yeah the typical music snob album. But this album is, seriously, a masterpiece front-to-back. I had listened to the songs <i>King of Carrot Flowers pt. 1</i> and the title track <i>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</i> prior to listening to the whole album, and the rest of the album adds so much to those songs. The vast instrumentation, vocal delivery of Jeff Magnum, and the lyrics (to an extent) all culminate in a fantastic album.</p>

                                <h3>The Low End Theory</h3>
                                <h4>A Tribe Called Quest, <i>1991</i></h4>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>I had a massive 90's hip hop phase in early 2024 that has stuck with me until now. Out of all of the albums, artists, and tracks I've listened to since then, none of them hit the sweet spot of lyrical content, delivery, and production like this album. Upbeat tracks, laid-back tracks, and everything in between can be found on this album. The only thing I don't like about this is that the album is a double-album despite being 46 minutes in length. It's a pain to listen to on physical media for that reason.</p>

                                <h3>Pink Moon</h3>
                                <h4>Nick Drake, <i>1972</i></h4>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>I feel like this, Elliott Smith, and Jeff Buckley is the (un)holy trinity of sad music. This album absolutely deserves its place among the other two. In contrast to the more upbeat and flushed-out sounds of Nick's previous two albums, this one is, for the most part, just him and his guitar. His depression at the time seeps into this music, leading to another heart-wrenching album.</p>

                                <h4>Olivia Rodrigo, <i>2021</i></h4>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>This is the first vinyl I ever bought! I went to an Olivia Rodrigo GUTS tour popup in Toronto with my friends (for some reason), and rather than buying a hoodie or T-shirt that I wouldn't be caught dead wearing, I decided to get a vinyl. I actually bought this before I even had a vinyl player! This is probably my least favourite album out of the ones in my collection, which isn't saying a lot since my collection is mostly 10/10 albums.</p>
