                    <p>When I was in Grade 9, I saw that one of my friends was using their laptop in class on a website called <a href="www.codecademy.com">codecademy.com</a>, learning a "programming language" called Python.</p>
                    <p>I'd never heard of programming before, but I'd always been interested in computers from a young age. Some of my earliest memories are in front of a computer, printing off fake Pokemon cards that I made (and almost certainly getting viruses on my parents' computer).</p>
                    <p>So I asked him to tell me about the website he was on, ended up using it myself and joining our school's FIRST Robotics team as a programmer (RIP Cyberheart 6009), and the rest is history! I've been coding ever since.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Some of my favourite hobbies these days involve playing video games (my current favourites are Minecraft and Rocket League), <a href="music.html">collecting vinyls</a>, and <a href="linux.html">using/tweaking Linux!</a></p>
